  Luxury Access Club was still in the ideation phase when we started this project. Its aim is to offer accessible, affordable luxury to its users/members, so that they can experience what luxury hotels & resorts offer without the expense of having to book a room.<br>
  ​
  <br>Our goal was to  research and validate whether or not Luxury Access Club was a viable and desirable proposition for both  users and for luxury hotels and resorts.  </p>

      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <p>Over 4 weeks, myself and my fellow team member were charged with researching and validating the need for the
        new Luxury Access Club website.<br><br>
        We focused on designing a responsive website that will offer affordable, accessible luxury to users via single
        day pass access or membership option, so that they will be able to experience what luxury hotels have to offer
        without having to be an in-house guest.</p>

      <p>With some interviews already completed, by our client it was evident that our target audience was people in

        30's- according to those findings, people in their 30's are far more likely to pay for comfort & luxury when
        travelling.

        One potential problem with these findings was that all of those interviewed had, in some way, a connection to
        our
        client so we felt that we needed to dive deeper to validate Luxury Access Club with no potential biases.</p>

      From our research, the main concern that people had was whether they might be treated differently or that they may

        offer membership options, only a single use offering.
        With that in mind, we wanted to highlight the different flows that users would journey through:</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Although a hi-fi fidelity prototype wasn't one of the requested deliverables, when we tested with SME's, it
      seemed that they really appreciated having a tangible product to interact with.
      I felt that by offering them the prototype to interact with they could actually understand how the Luxury Access
      Club website would work & this might not have been quite so clear when running usability testing with them if we
      only had a lo-fi prototype to offer them.</p>
